## Gulp Tasks

All tasks are listed below, but ideally you will just need to run `gulp start` and be done with it.

- `gulp start`: This is the primary task that will fire up the server and allow you to start building
- `gulp server`: This will start a Browsersync server with live-reload
- `gulp sass`: This will compile your SASS
- `gulp browserify`: This will transpile your JS from ES6 to ES5
- `gulp watch`: This will start a watcher for files
